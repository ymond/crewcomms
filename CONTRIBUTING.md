# Contributing

Crew Comms follows strict XP + test-first workflow.

Every feature follows the cycle:
Planner → Tester → Implementer → Chronicler → Planner → …

## Planner
Defines scope & acceptance criteria. No code.

## Tester
Writes failing tests for the scope. No implementation.

## Implementer
Makes the tests pass with minimal code. No new tests.

## Chronicler
Documents the change, updates SESSION_LOG and PLAN.

## Single-scope PRs
Each PR must implement exactly one increment.
